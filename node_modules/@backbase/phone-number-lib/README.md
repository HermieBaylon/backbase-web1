### Tweaks

- metadata.js
 This uses a semver compare library, we dont need this.
 So its removed both from package.json and this file.
 Also `this.v2` is `false` according to tests, so without the need on semver compare, set this to false.

- download.js
 This downloads PhoneNumberMetadata everytime update-metadata is run. Removed.

- .bin folder
 Runs update-metadata.js which checks whether theres a change between downloaded metadata and already existing one. Removed.

### Build
- npm i
- npm run metadata:generate (generates country metadata)
- npm run build (generates es6, build and bundle folders)

### metadata.min.json

- Right now we use even a smaller metadata.json (for only CA, US, GB, NL) it is named bb-metadata.json
 So the paths for this inside index.es6 and index.common js files are changed
