# Foundation Collection

Foundation Collection contains the fundamental libraries for building Angular applications with Backbase.

## Features

Foundation Collection uses the Backbase architecture to let you easily adopt Backbase product features using established frontend technologies. It's based on the `@backbase/foundation-ang` collection of libraries. Use these to build the core functionality of your Backbase Angular applications.

This collection provides Backbase-specific injectable Angular services and directives that are used by applications.

### `@backbase/foundation-ang/web-sdk`

Provides core web services, for example: [`PubSubService`](./injectables/PubSubService.html).

### `@backbase/foundation-ang/auth`

Provides services to support [Backbase Authorization capabilities](https://community.backbase.com/documentation/foundation_angular/latest/authenticate_users).

### `@backbase/foundation-ang/entitlements`

Contains tools to work with [Backbase Entitlements](https://community.backbase.com/documentation/foundation_angular/latest/entitlements).

### `@backbase/foundation-ang/data-http`

Provides a module with HTTP configuration for data modules and utils to mock API HTTP requests. For more information, see [Understand data modules](https://community.backbase.com/documentation/foundation_angular/latest/work_with_rest_data_services).

## Requirements

Foundation Collection requires the following product versions:

- [node 14.x](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/)
- npm 6.14.13 or later
- Angular 10, 11, or 12.

Download 14.x version of NodeJS from https://nodejs.org/en/download and follow the installation instructions for latest LTS version.

npm (NodeJS Package Manager) is installed at the same time as NodeJS by default. Ensure that your npm version is 6.14.13 or later.

To update npm to version 6.14.13, run the following command::

    npm install -g npm@^6.14.13


## Installation

To install the Foundation Collection, follow these steps:

1. Set up the Backbase NPM registry `https://repo.backbase.com/artifactory/api/npm/npm-backbase/` for the `@backbase` namespace:

       npm adduser --registry=https://repo.backbase.com/artifactory/api/npm/npm-backbase/ --always-auth --scope=@backbase

2. Install the `@backbase/foundation-ang` package:

       npm install @backbase/foundation-ang --save
