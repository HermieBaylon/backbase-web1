# Backbase Banking Apps contribution rules

Great to see you here ready to contribute to this project! You can find useful information below.

## Development Setup

Could be found in [README](./README.md#Development-Setup).

## Contribution

In general, the workflow looks as follows:

- Create a branch
- Apply all necessary changes, mind a linting and a unit test coverage
- Open a PR to `main`, check that pipeline build is successful
- If your update should also be in a release branch, ping a person in charge of that release, so they would cherry-pick your changes to the release branch.

## Versioning

### Auto Versioning

A pipeline is set up to update an app version automatically, so it's highly encouraged to not change it manually and avoid possible conflicts PR and keep work in a predictable manner.
The version would be bumped and new tag would be associated with a commit.

Following rules are applied during automatic update:

- if branch has a `bugfix` or `hotfix` part in a name, then it's treated as a `patch` update, i.e. `x.y.z` -> `x.y.z+1`
- in other cases it's `minor`, i.e. `x.y.z` -> `x.y+1.z`
  If a major release with breaking changes takes place, then the version must be bumped manually using [an instruction](#Manual-Versioning) for manual versioning below.

### Manual Versioning

If you need to change an app version in `package.json` and `package-lock.json` manually (e.g. a major update, etc.), don't forget to add to a commit message following text - `bump/<version>` or `--skip-bump`.
Otherwise, the pipeline will bump the version automatically.

### Release Versioning

If the pipeline runs for a release branch, then an image and commit tags would be automatically set in CalVer according to branch name. For commit the name of a value stream would also be used.
I.e. branch `release/<VS_name>/2022.04` sets an image tag to `2022.04` and a commit tag to `business/2022.04`. This functionality _doesn't_ affect a `package.json` version.

## Localization

Localizations are generated automatically via a pipeline.
If you want to generate them manually and skip this step in the pipeline, add `--skip-i18n` to your commit message.

## Branching strategy

This repository uses trunk-based development approach. That means that developers open PRs to the single `main` from their short-lived feature branches.
This strategy is [recommended](https://nx.dev/guides/monorepo-nx-enterprise#trunk-based-development) by the NX team.
More information about trunk-based development could be found [here](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/).

### During release

During a release process each Value Stream create a branch in a format `release/<VS_name>/<version>`, e.g. `release/business/2022.04`.
If an update or a fix required for the release, it should be addressed in `main` and then a person responsible for the release cherry-pick commits from `main`.

## Release

For a release we should use a branching strategy described above.

The flow looks like follows:

- The pipeline from `Jenkinsfile` automatically builds the apps and generates translation files (if no `--skip-i18n` is used)
- If required, the pipeline from `Jenkinsfile` automatically bumps the package version
- The pipeline from `Jenkinsfile` automatically tags the last commit in branch with `<VS_name>/<CalVer>`
- The pipeline from `Jenkinsfile` pushes to `harbor/staging` an image with a tag `<version from package.json>`
- If required, you can manually run a re-tagging pipeline to change a tag and/or to promote from `harbor/staging` to `harbor/internal`

#### Why does it work like that?

The idea is that a pipeline shouldnâ€™t push to `harbor/staging` with `imageTag` = CalVer, because one VS's release branch may have a commit that
triggers a build with `affected` for another VS, hereby overwrites a release image to someone else. The pipeline bumps version from `package.json` in a
release branches using a pattern `a.b.c-rc.<VS>.x`, e.g. `1.0.3-rc.business.0`. Then a re-tagging pipeline could be used to promote that image from
staging to internal and rename it to CalVer.

#### Re-tagging an image

A person responsible for a release can use [this pipeline](https://jenkins.backbase.eu/job/Frontend%20Guild/job/BSFG/view/Freestyle/job/retag-banking-app-image/)
to re-tag an image from SemVer to CalVer and/or promote it withing harbor projects (from `staging` to `internal`) using job's parameters.
